# Vulnerability Type
Privilege Escalation

# Severity
TBD (Upon Analysis)

# Vendor
The Open Source Robotics Foundation (OSRF)

# Products Affected
ROS2 Foxy Fitzroy (ROS_VERSION=2 and ROS_PYTHON_VERSION=3)

# Description

Code Execution: True; 
Escalation of Privileges: True.

# Attack Vector
The vulnerability can be exploited by leveraging software bugs, manipulating permission settings, and executing unauthorized code.

# Solution
Users are urged to upgrade to the latest patched version of ROS2 Foxy Fitzroy, where this vulnerability has been addressed. It's crucial to ensure that all associated components are updated to secure versions to prevent exploitation.

# Workaround
In the absence of an immediate update, users should implement stringent security controls, including regular audits of permission settings and monitoring for unusual activity indicative of unauthorized code execution.

# CVE Status
Confirmed and published.
